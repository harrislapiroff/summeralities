I was planing to write about Dean Spade's *Normal Life*, but the book turned out to be somewhat too dense for a single week, so instead I am writing about Sonia Sanchez's book of love poems: *Like the Singing Coming off the Drums* and I will plan on getting *Normal Life* next week.

* * *

At first I didn't know what I was going to write about this book of poems (besides that they are brief, beautiful, unpretentious, and full of passion and *soul*) but something happened while I was reading them. I found that I loved the poems so much that I wanted to share them. All day, as I was reading this book, when I encountered a friend, I'd pass the book to them and ask them to read a few poems. What I discovered was that the things that surprise my friends in poetry are different than the things that surprise me; the things that they don't expect are the things I take for granted.

For instance: I take for granted poetry's intimate connection with hip hop. But when I showed the dedication to Tupac Amaru Shakur to a friend, her instinctive reaction was "Is that a different Tupac?" It was a connection she was not able to take for granted, or even anticipate.

A great deal of the poetry I read is about sex--I practically expect it in most poems by now. Yet, when I shared this haiku--which I find passionate and evocative--with a couple friends, they were surprised and amused by its candidness:

> **Blues Haiku**
>
> when we say good-bye  
> i want yo tongue inside my  
> mouth dancing hello.

One of them asked, "Are they all this sexual?" and I could think of no response but, "Um. Some much more so." I have long inhabited a world of poetry that includes, along with Sonia Sanchez, poets like Lucille Clifton. (This poem is not from this book, but included in this blog post for comparison.):

> **To A Dark Moses**
>
> You are the one  
> I am lit for.  
> Come with your rod  
> that twists  
> and is a serpent.  
> I am the bush.  
> I am burning  
> I am not consumed.  
>
> -- Lucille Clifton

And so, having explored this world of poetry for a long time, candid sex in poetry is not unusual to me. Yet it surprises my friends.

Or I take for granted that the lines between music and poetry are fuzzy, but when I showed a friend this particularly lyrical poem, her reaction was "How is this different from a song?" (To her credit, she was probably intending the question to prompt a conversation about music and poetry.)

> **Blues**
>
> *for Deb*
>
> even though you came in december be my january man,  
> i say, even though you came in december be my january man,  
> but you know i'll take you any month i can
>
> woke up this morning, waiting for you to call  
> say, i woke up this morning waiting for you to call  
> started shaking in my bed, thought i was taking another fall.  
>
> fortune teller, fortune teller, what you forecast for me today,  
> fortune teller, fortune teller, what you forecast for me today,  
> cuz i ain't got no time to be messing with yo yesterday.
>
> even though you came in december be my january man,  
> i say, even though you came in december be my january man,  
> but you know i'll take you any month i can  
> but you know i'll take you any month i can.

To me the answer is that it doesn't matter whether it is a poem or a song. Probably--by most reasonable definitions--it could be considered both. It's my feeling that *of course* poetry and music have significant overlap. But no matter how you categorize it, it is beautiful. And what I love so much about this poem is that you can hear it sung, even as you read it.

So perhaps this is what makes this book so special--even within her adherence to traditional poetic forms (numerous haikus and tankas) Sanchez's poems break boundaries. Within formal structures, she presents a casual bluesy tone, full sexuality, music, and feeling.

> **Blues Haiku**
>
> let me be yo wil  
> derness let me be yo wind  
> blowing you all day.  

I find these brief poems addicting. Even the ones which she does not mark as bluesy are beautiful, modest, and heartbreaking:

> **Haiku**
>
> i have caught fire from  
> your mouth now you want me to  
> swallow the ocean.  
> 
> **Haiku**
>
> it was nothing big  
> just no one to put suntan  
> lotion on my back.  
>
> **Tanka**
> 
> i thought about you  
> the pain of not having  
> you cruising my bones.  
> no morning saliva smiles this  
> frantic fugue about no you.

Looking back on these poems, I suppose they *are* surprising, in their own way. She concludes the book with some longer poems written for famous figures including Ella Fitzgerald, Tupac Shakur, and Cornel West--each of which is also lovely.

The whole book is unpretentious, surprising, emotional and--most importantly to me--beautiful.
