Winter, now:

Some nights, your hair is  
&nbsp;&nbsp;the dark wood I am lost in.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wake in cold sweats.  
  
I am practicing  
&nbsp;&nbsp;ways of saying I love you,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none rightâ€”  
  
Sometimes, a window:  
  
Pressing my lips  
&nbsp;&nbsp;to the cold glass pane, I breathe  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you disappear.
