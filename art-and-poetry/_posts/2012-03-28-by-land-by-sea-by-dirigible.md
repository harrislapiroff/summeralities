Words from [the Decemberists](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5H8DwJI0uA).

My mother saw one of my paintings once. I had mixed a pale blue, v. low in saturation and used it almost exclusively, layer after layer. She gifted me a tube of [Payne's grey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payne's_grey), saying, "This is the color you want." She was right.

I sent this to a few lovely people in pieces to see if they would piece it together. They did.
