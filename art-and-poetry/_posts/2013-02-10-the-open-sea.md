each sound escaping is a small promise made  
each the last escape raft life line hatch into the interstial  
grip loosened, nylon cord slackened and pulled free  
each promise escaping is a small sound made  
one, the sigh slipping from your lips. two, the roar of the open sea.  
three, the sigh of the opened ship, four, the roar of the fish all freed  
the moan of supple wood, five, and six, the gnash of waves on the lee  
each escape made is a small, sound promise  
each life raft, the last line,â€”escape hatch into the interstitial  
see where we are going, grip loosened, nylon cord unraveled, pulled free -  
you and i, two small boats, the open sea.
