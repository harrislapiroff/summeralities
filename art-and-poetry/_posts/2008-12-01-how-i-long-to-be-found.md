title: How I Long to be Found in a Time Beyond Love

November when air is warm with climate change,  
I pray for nuclear winter, another ice age,  
a snow that falls soft and lovely and enduring.  
  
You and I wandering the streets of Albany  
and out to the beach, flakes of aftermath  
dropping one by one by one onto our limbs  
weighing down until we move no longer but only  
sleep compressed under thousands of pounds of powder,  
found millennia later by excavators  
with tinted goggles and laser drills.  
  
Our pictures on the news,  
us kept below zero in a block of ice  
preserving our perfect bodies.  
  
An archeologist leading a tour points and says  
see their strange clothes, the way they wear their hair  
see the way their eyes light up at one another  
and the way their fingers twine.
