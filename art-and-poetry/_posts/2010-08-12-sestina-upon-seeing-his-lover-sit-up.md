title: Sestina Upon Seeing His Lover Sit Up

Many men lost in this darkness  
have taken to the bottle but this quick vessel  
takes me; I am neither hand nor foot, only what will  
has made me—and the will to follow  
is strong. When I drink, spots appear.  
When I exhale, your name is on my breath.  
  
I suppose the honey on your breath  
should have been my sign in darkness:  
Things Are Not As They Appear.  
I should have seen your face, still a vessel  
of light, a torch for me to follow.  
Oh, little love! In the future I will  
  
do better, if you will  
lean close, lip to lip—return breath  
to my body and the soul will follow.  
After all it is known—Is it not?—that in darkness  
Love is the boat sailing home, a vessel  
of some power. But you press your lips to mine and it appears  
  
not so. If you asked me why it appeared  
so important to speedily will  
myself to eternity—to steer this fleshy vessel  
to the underworld; though love never was simple as breath—  
all I can say is that darkness  
clouded my mind—I could only follow.  
  
Listen, don’t just follow—  
finish your sonnet, live to see 14 candles appear,  
making light of the darkness.  
Death is long-lived—you will  
see me there before it draws its last breath,  
but Life is the vessel  
  
to bear you there—the vessel  
that you must ride and follow  
through. Recall what you said as I held my breath  
about parting till the dawn appears.  
We’ll part a little longer, little love—will  
that dagger return to the darkness.  
  
Little love, like wine from its vessel so pours my breath.  
A single cell flares in darkness. I pray do not follow.  
But I will my eyes open—and you appear.
