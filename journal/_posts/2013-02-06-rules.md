title: "Nine Rules for Reading"
---

These are the rules that govern my reading. They're not really rules, though,--more like guidelines. Except for number 1, which *is*, in fact, a rule.

In no particular order:

1. Finish one book every week and write about it. No exceptions.[^1]

2. Set aside a time every day to read. That's the only way this works.

3. Start every book expecting to like it.

4. If, after 30 pages or so, you do not like it after all, feel free to abandon it.

5. Read "easy" books alongside the difficult ones. One per week is a rigorous pace.

6. Take notes. Especially at this pace, it helps retention.

7. Read books in a diversity of genres and from a diversity of authors. In particular, make a conscious effort to read books from voices that have been underrepresented.

8. In writing reflections, try less to review the book's quality and more to detail what you gained from swimming in the universe of that book for a week.

9. Use each book to grow a little.

[^1]: N.b., This is not an exception, exactly, but a clarification: "finishing" a book does not necessitate starting the book that same week. I'll often start two books at a time--a short one and a long one--and finish the short one the first week and the long one the second week. Just as long as a book gets finished every week.
