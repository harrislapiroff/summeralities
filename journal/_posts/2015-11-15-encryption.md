title: "Encryption Technology and Terrorism"
---

I am deeply unhappy about media embracing a narrative that blames encryption for terrorism. Encryption protects people everywhere, including you, every day. It's what ensures that your private communications, your personal information, your location and activities, and your identity are protected from stalkers, identity thieves, corporations, and governments. Encryption is what allows you to communicate over various secure channels (including iMessage, among others) without the fear that someone could be eavesdropping.

Certain departments in the U.S. government—in particular the FBI and NSA—have been trying for a long time to convince the public that encryption is a danger to the world. They want to enact policies that require companies providing this encryption to weaken that encryption and increase their ability to conduct surveillance on the public. The increased attention on encryption after this latest round of terrorism is both an opportunistic attempt to promote this surveillance-happy agenda _and_ a tactic to distract from the failures of surveillance agencies and the deeper responsibilities for the rise of ISIS.

A world without encryption or with encryption that is deliberately hamstrung (by security "backdoors") is a world in which the "bad guys" eventually have access to your private personal information, with all the dangers that entails.

  > For most major terror attacks, the perpetrators were either known to Western security agencies or they had ample reason to watch them. All three perpetrators of the Charlie Hebdo massacre “were known to French authorities,” as was the thwarted train attacker in July and at least one of the Paris attackers. These agencies receive billions and billions of dollars every year and radical powers, all in the name of surveilling Bad People and stopping attacks.
